**Citizen Model Manager** lets you customize your city's population by assigning unique models to specific citizen groups.

* Dynamic Model Assignment: Use any loaded "CharacterGroup" prefab to change the appearance of different citizen categories (child/teen/adult/senior, male/female, warm/cold or homeless), creating a diverse and visually appealing cityscape however you like.
While instructions for creating your own model packs are on the way, you can explore the features now with the Sully's citizen packs, which includes a pre-made model packs for Sully's Venice, LA series.

Stay tuned on Sully's YouTube channel for detailed instructions on creating your own custom model packs, allowing you to fully personalize the citizens in your city!
